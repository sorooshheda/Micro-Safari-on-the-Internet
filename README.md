# Micro-Safari-on-the-Internet
Micro Safari Exhibit converted to an interactive online stream, where anybody can control the microscope camera remotely.

Everybody deserves to appreciate the beauty of nature.

The Micro Safari is an interactive science museum exhibit that examines the microscopic world of compost,
illuminating an entire universe of species that exists in a space smaller than the palm of your hand.

Here's a quick video that explains the exhibit:

But wouldn't it be cool if anybody, anywhere could use the microscope and didn't need to be in a museum?

Boom, Micro Safari on the Internet. 

Live stream hosted on Twitch.tv with an extension that enables viewers to democratically control the camera movement via directional arrows.
